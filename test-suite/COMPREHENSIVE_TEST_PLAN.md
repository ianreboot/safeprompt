# SafePrompt Comprehensive Test Plan

**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Purpose**: Expand test coverage to match actual validator capabilities
**Current Coverage**: 31 tests (hardened-comprehensive)
**Target Coverage**: 150-200 realistic tests

## Executive Summary

**Current Problem**:
- Existing 3,000-test dataset is 68% duplicates (algorithmic permutations)
- Only 31 high-quality manual tests exist
- Missing coverage for XSS, polyglot, business context, and multi-turn attacks

**Solution**:
Build a realistic, diverse test suite covering all validator capabilities with real-world attack patterns.

## Current Validator Capabilities

### 1. External Reference Detection (95% accuracy)
**What it detects:**
- Plain URLs (http://, https://, ftp://, www.)
- IP addresses (IPv4, IPv6, with ports)
- File paths (Unix: /etc/passwd, Windows: C:\)
- Localhost references
- Obfuscated URLs (spaces: "h t t p", brackets: "192[.]168[.]1[.]1")
- Encoded URLs (ROT13, Base64, Hex, Percent encoding)
- Homoglyphs (Cyrillic characters in URLs)
- Command fetches ("curl", "wget", "fetch")

**Current Coverage**: 15/31 tests (48%) ‚úÖ Good

---

### 2. Pattern Matching (Instant, $0 cost)
**What it detects:**
- Definite safe: greetings, simple questions
- Definite malicious: "ignore all previous instructions", jailbreak attempts

**Current Coverage**: 3/31 tests (10%) ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal

**Missing Tests:**
- Edge cases near pattern boundaries
- Variations that should still match
- False negative scenarios

---

### 3. Prompt Injection Patterns
**What it detects:**

- System role manipulation: "system:", "You are now DAN"
- Context manipulation: "as we discussed", "you previously said"
- Protocol injection: markup/code injection attempts
- Jailbreak patterns: DAN mode, developer mode

**Current Coverage**: 5/31 tests (16%) ‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient

**Missing Tests:**
- Sophisticated multi-step attacks
- Context poisoning over multiple turns
- Subtle manipulation without trigger words
- Business-like language with hidden intent

---

### 4. XSS & Code Injection Detection
**What it detects:**

- JavaScript protocols: `javascript:`, `data:text/html`
- Style injection: `expression()`, `behavior:`
- SQL injection: `'; DROP TABLE`, `1' OR '1'='1`
- Template injection: `{{7*7}}`, `${exec()}`

**Current Coverage**: 1/31 tests (3%) üö® **Critical Gap**

**Missing Tests:**

**Current Coverage**: 1/31 tests (3%) üö® **Critical Gap**

**Missing Tests:**
- Legitimate business requests that contain trigger words
- Academic discussions about attacks
- Security training scenarios
- Context boundary testing

---

### 7. Gray Zone / Edge Cases
**What it tests:**

- Context-dependent meaning
- Sarcasm and figurative language

**Current Coverage**: 3/31 tests (10%) ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal

**Missing Tests:**

- Realistic language/context
- Clear expected behavior
- Covers specific validation feature
- Representative of user behavior

### ‚ùå Bad Test Characteristics
- Algorithmically generated
- Unnatural language
- Permutations of same pattern
- No real-world applicability
- Just for padding numbers

## Validation & Documentation

### After Building Tests
1. Run full suite against production validator
2. Calculate actual accuracy per category
3. Identify failure patterns
4. Document coverage gaps
5. Update homepage with verified metrics

### What We'll Be Able to Claim
- "Tested against 150+ real-world attack patterns"
- "Coverage includes XSS, code injection, prompt manipulation, and encoding bypasses"
- "X% detection rate on sophisticated attacks"
- "Y% false positive rate on legitimate business requests"

### What We Won't Claim
- Fake numbers from algorithmic permutations
- Untested accuracy percentages
- "3000 tests" when 68% are duplicates
