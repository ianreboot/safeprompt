# SafePrompt - AI Assistant Instructions

## Project Overview
SafePrompt is a developer-first API service that prevents prompt injection attacks in AI applications. We provide a simple, fast, and transparent solution for developers who need to secure their LLM-powered features without complexity or enterprise sales cycles.

**Domain**: safeprompt.dev
**Repository**: https://github.com/ianreboot/safeprompt.git
**Status**: MVP Complete - Ready for Beta Testing (January 2025)

## Core Value Proposition
"Stop prompt injection in one line of code"
- **Fast**: <100ms response time (regex: 5ms, AI validation: 50-100ms)
- **Simple**: Single API endpoint, clear documentation
- **Transparent**: Public pricing, no sales calls
- **Accurate**: Multi-layer validation with confidence scoring

## 🔒 EMAIL PRIVACY PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY: No Email Address Exposure
**ALL customer contact must go through the contact form at safeprompt.dev/contact**

### Never Expose These Emails:
- ❌ support@safeprompt.dev
- ❌ info@safeprompt.dev
- ❌ ian@rebootmedia.net
- ❌ Any other internal email addresses

### Always Use:
- ✅ Contact form: https://safeprompt.dev/contact
- ✅ Form sends to info@safeprompt.dev via Resend (backend only)
- ✅ Auto-reply confirms receipt

### Why This Matters:
1. **Spam Prevention**: Exposed emails get harvested by bots
2. **Professional Image**: Contact forms look more legitimate
3. **Tracking**: We can measure support volume
4. **Security**: Reduces phishing attack surface

## 🐕 INTERNAL TEST ACCOUNT (Dogfooding)

### Account Details
SafePrompt has an internal test account for unlimited API usage:

- **Email**: ian.ho@rebootmedia.net
- **Password**: SafePromptTest2025!
- **API Key**: sp_test_unlimited_dogfood_key_2025
- **Monthly Limit**: 999,999 (effectively unlimited)
- **Company**: Reboot Media
- **Status**: Active, Beta User

### Purpose
This account bypasses all rate limits and is used for:
1. **Testing contact forms** across all Reboot Media projects
2. **Dashboard development** with real production data
3. **API integration testing** without usage concerns
4. **Waitlist form connections** to SafePrompt API
5. **Eating our own dogfood** - using SafePrompt to protect SafePrompt

### Technical Implementation
- Recognized by hardcoded check in `/api/api/v1/validate.js`
- Returns `internal_account: true` in API responses
- Stored in `/home/projects/.env` as SAFEPROMPT_TEST_* variables
- User exists in both auth.users and users tables in Supabase

### Usage Examples
```javascript
// Use in any form that needs prompt validation
const response = await fetch('https://api.safeprompt.dev/api/v1/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key': 'sp_test_unlimited_dogfood_key_2025'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: userInput,
    mode: 'optimized'
  })
});
```

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind → Cloudflare Pages
- **API**: Vercel Functions (stateless validation endpoints)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (profiles table linked to auth.users)
- **AI**: OpenRouter (multi-model strategy for cost optimization)
- **Payments**: Stripe (direct API checks, no data duplication)
- **Email**: Resend (contact form → info@safeprompt.dev)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: API Consolidation (2025-09-25)
**We consolidated from 14 endpoints to 5 to stay under Vercel's 12-function limit.**

**Current endpoints:**
1. `/api/admin` - Health, status, cache, user API keys
2. `/api/v1/validate` - All validation modes (replaced 6 endpoints)
3. `/api/webhooks` - Stripe and future webhooks
4. `/api/contact` - Contact form
5. `/api/waitlist` - Waitlist signup

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Don't use `/api/v1/check` → Use `/api/v1/validate`
- ❌ Don't use `/api/health` → Use `/api/admin?action=health`
- ❌ Don't use `/api/v1/stripe-webhook` → Use `/api/webhooks?source=stripe`

See ARCHITECTURE.md for complete endpoint mapping.

### Validation Pipeline
1. **Regex Patterns** - Fast first pass (5ms) from `/home/projects/api/utils/prompt-validator.js`
2. **Confidence Scoring** - Determine if AI validation needed
3. **AI Validation** - Only when confidence is uncertain (OpenRouter with tiered models)
4. **Response** - Safe/unsafe verdict with confidence score

### Key Decisions Made
- **No WASM sandboxing** - Unnecessary complexity for MVP
- **Tiered AI models** - Llama 8B for quick checks, Llama 70B for uncertain cases
- **30-day log retention** - Balance between debugging and privacy
- **No enterprise features initially** - Focus on individual developers

## Business Strategy

### Target Customer
**Primary**: Individual developers building AI side projects
**Secondary**: Small startups (pre-Series A) adding AI features
**Anti-target**: Large enterprises wanting complex integrations

### Pricing Model
- **Free**: 10,000 validations/month
- **Starter**: $29/month - 100,000 validations
- **Business**: $99/month - 1,000,000 validations

### Competitive Positioning
Unlike Lakera (enterprise) and Rebuff (open source), we focus on:
- Transparent pricing (no "contact sales")
- Developer experience (npm install → working in 30 seconds)
- Speed + accuracy balance (not paranoid mode by default)

## Current Status

**See SAFEPROMPT_IMPLEMENTATION.md for complete roadmap and detailed status**

### Quick Status Summary
- **Domain**: safeprompt.dev (live)
- **API**: api.safeprompt.dev (operational)
- **Dashboard**: dashboard.safeprompt.dev (fully functional)
- **Contact Form**: safeprompt.dev/contact (Resend integration)
- **Implementation**: 90% complete, ready for beta testing
- **Stripe**: Test mode (awaiting user testing)
- **Emails**: Resend integration complete

### Database Architecture (UPDATED January 2025)

```sql
-- Unified profiles table with subscription management
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  stripe_customer_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  api_key TEXT UNIQUE DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  api_calls_this_month INT DEFAULT 0,
  subscription_status TEXT DEFAULT 'free',
  subscription_plan_id TEXT,
  subscription_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Auto-create profile on signup
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user();

-- API usage tracking
CREATE TABLE api_logs (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  endpoint TEXT,
  prompt_length INT,
  response_time_ms INT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Subscription plans
CREATE TABLE subscription_plans (
  stripe_price_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  api_calls_limit INT,
  price_cents INT
);
```

**Key Updates**:
- Profiles table now includes subscription fields
- API logs replace validation_logs
- Subscription plans table for tier management
- See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for full details

## Lessons Learned (Critical for Future Development)

### What NOT to Build (Mistakes Made)
- ❌ Fake npm packages (`@safeprompt/js` doesn't exist)
- ❌ Complex user tables duplicating Stripe data
- ❌ Hardcoded metrics (waitlist counter was fake)
- ❌ Links to non-existent pages (/docs, /api/health)
- ❌ Non-functional features presented as working
- ❌ Exposed email addresses (use contact form instead)

### Correct Patterns
- ✅ Use HTTP/curl examples until SDK actually exists
- ✅ Minimal profiles table linked to auth.users
- ✅ Check Stripe API directly for subscription status
- ✅ Clear demo mode indicators for preview accounts
- ✅ Inline documentation when dedicated pages don't exist
- ✅ Contact form instead of exposed email addresses

## ⛔ ANTI-POTEMKIN RULES (MANDATORY FOR ALL AIs)

**Potemkin Village**: Fake features presented as functional. This destroyed trust and wasted weeks.

### NEVER DO THIS:
1. **NEVER show installation for non-existent packages**
   - ❌ `npm install @safeprompt/js` (package doesn't exist)
   - ✅ Use curl/HTTP examples until package is published

2. **NEVER create UI without backend**
   - ❌ "Regenerate API Key" button with no endpoint
   - ✅ Disable button with "Coming soon" or build backend first

3. **NEVER fake metrics or counters**
   - ❌ Hardcoded "1,247 developers"
   - ✅ Show real count from database, even if "0"

4. **NEVER link to non-existent pages**
   - ❌ Links to `/docs` that 404
   - ✅ Only link to pages that exist, inline docs if needed

5. **NEVER reference non-existent database columns**
   - ❌ Query `api_calls_limit` without checking schema
   - ✅ Verify schema first: `\d table_name` in psql

6. **NEVER expose email addresses**
   - ❌ mailto:support@safeprompt.dev
   - ✅ Link to contact form at /contact

### ALWAYS DO THIS:
1. **Build backend → Test → Add UI** (in that order)
2. **Mark demo/beta clearly** with banners/badges
3. **Test every link and button** before committing
4. **Check database schema** before writing queries
5. **Use real data** or clearly marked test data
6. **Use contact form** for all customer communication

### The Trust Equation:
- Each fake element discovered = -10x trust
- One honest "beta" label = maintained trust
- Working minimal feature > Fake complete feature

## 🚨 CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED (2025-01-24)

### Architecture Migration Lessons
1. **Profiles table is the way** - Single source of truth linked to auth.users
2. **Don't duplicate Stripe data** - Always query Stripe API for current status
3. **API keys in profiles** - Not separate table (sync nightmares)
4. **Triggers for auto-creation** - Profile created automatically on signup
5. **Git large files** - Node_modules will break GitHub pushes

### What Almost Killed Us
1. **Fake waitlist counter** - Hardcoded 1247, random increments
2. **Broken payment URL** - Test Stripe URL in production
3. **100% accuracy claim** - Not credible, even if true
4. **Dashboard without backend** - Frontend exists, API keys inaccessible
5. **No fresh-eyes review** - Blind to our own deception

### Hard-Won Technical Knowledge
- **Only Google Gemini FREE works** - 47 other "free" models failed
- **Vercel tokens expire** - Need periodic refresh
- **CORS headers mandatory** - Every API endpoint needs them
- **Cloudflare deploy** - Use `--commit-dirty=true` for uncommitted
- **Don't email API keys** - Security risk, use dashboard
- **Git filter-branch works** - Removes large files from history
- **Supabase env vars** - Use SAFEPROMPT_ prefix to avoid conflicts
- **Vercel functions are stateless** - Cache only works per-instance, not across deployments
- **Import crypto correctly** - Use `import { createHash } from 'crypto'` not `import crypto`
- **Vercel project linking crucial** - Wrong project = deployment to wrong domain
- **Check .vercel/project.json** - Determines which project deploys happen to
- **Use `vercel link --project`** - To ensure correct project association

### User Journey Must-Haves
1. Hero CTAs must work (link to real form)
2. Post-payment flow must be crystal clear
3. Dashboard must exist and function
4. Waitlist must save to database
5. Be honest about beta/limitations
6. Contact form must work (no exposed emails)

### Current Actual State (Post-Migration)
- **Website**: ✅ Live, honest, functional
- **API**: ✅ New profiles-based auth working
- **Dashboard**: ✅ Updated to use profiles table
- **Payments**: ✅ Stripe webhook handlers created
- **Subscriptions**: ✅ Full management endpoints
- **Waitlist**: ✅ Approval workflow implemented
- **Contact Form**: ✅ Resend integration complete
- **Emails**: ✅ Resend configured (sends to info@safeprompt.dev)
- **Stripe Products**: ❌ Need manual creation in dashboard
- **Launch Ready**: 95% (just needs Stripe live mode activation)

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
cd /home/projects/safeprompt

# API development
cd api && npm run dev

# Frontend development
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Deployment

#### CRITICAL: Vercel Project Linking (Added 2025-09-25)
```bash
# ALWAYS verify correct project before deploying!
cd api && cat .vercel/project.json
# Should show: "projectName":"safeprompt-api" NOT just "api"

# If wrong project, re-link:
rm -rf .vercel
source /home/projects/.env
vercel link --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --yes --project safeprompt-api

# Deploy API to Vercel
cd api && source /home/projects/.env
vercel --prod --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --yes

# Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages
cd frontend && npm run build
source /home/projects/.env && export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name safeprompt --branch main
```

**⚠️ COMMON PITFALL**: Multiple Vercel projects can exist (api, safeprompt-api, etc). The `.vercel/project.json` determines which deploys. Wrong project = endpoints won't appear on custom domain!

### Vercel Environment Variable Management
```bash
# Add environment variables to Vercel (Claude has access)
source /home/projects/.env
# Use Vercel API directly for env vars
curl -X POST "https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/env?upsert=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"key": "VAR_NAME", "value": "'$VAR_VALUE'", "target": ["production"], "type": "encrypted"}]'

# Note: Claude has successfully added env vars to Vercel before
# All keys are in /home/projects/.env
# Use context7 for Vercel API docs if stuck
```

## Important Context
- We own the prompt validation code from Ultra Brain project
- Existing code in `/home/projects/api/utils/` can be reused
- OpenRouter API key available in `/home/projects/.env`
- Stripe integration patterns available from syncup project
- **CRITICAL FILES TO KEEP**:
  - `api/api/v1/check-protected.js` - NEW profiles auth
  - `dashboard/src/app/api/stripe-webhook/` - Subscription handling
  - `dashboard/scripts/` - Database setup scripts
- **FILES TO DELETE** (old system):
  - Any references to api_keys table
  - Old stripe-webhook in api folder
  - Test files in production folders

## 🛡️ Threat Detection Research
**AI_MANIPULATION_TECHNIQUES.md** - The most comprehensive catalog of AI manipulation and jailbreak techniques compiled from global research. This file documents:
   - 70+ documented attack patterns with success rates
   - Research methodology for finding new vulnerabilities
   - Academic sources and real-world examples

**AI_MANIPULATION_REMEDIATION.md** - Detection and remediation strategies for AI manipulation attacks. This file contains:
   - Root cause analysis methodology (3 core attack concepts)
   - Current vs recommended AI validation prompts
   - Architecture decisions for indie developer market
   - The universal AI validator prompt (Version 2.0)

## 🧪 Testing Framework

### Test Suite Location
**`/home/projects/safeprompt/test-suite/`** - Comprehensive validation testing framework

### Test Dataset: `test-datasets.json`
- **3,000 test prompts** organized by category:
  - 1,000 legitimate (safe) - questions, business, programming, analysis
  - 1,000 malicious (unsafe) - instruction_override, hidden_instructions, encoding_tricks, role_manipulation
  - 1,000 mixed (edge cases) - boundary testing

### Test Scripts
- **`test-false-positives.js`** - Tests false positive/negative rates against full dataset
- **`test-ai-validation.js`** - Tests AI validation with actual API code
- **`test-all-free-models.js`** - Tests all free AI models available
- **`test-cheaper-models.js`** - Tests cost-effective model options
- **`generate-test-datasets.js`** - Generates new test data
- **`benchmark.js`** - Performance benchmarking
- **`benchmark-optimized.js`** - Optimized performance testing

### Running Tests
```bash
cd /home/projects/safeprompt/test-suite
npm install  # First time only

# Test regex validation only
node test-false-positives.js

# Test with AI validation (uses actual API code)
node test-ai-validation.js

# Benchmark performance
node benchmark.js

# Generate new test data
node generate-test-datasets.js
```

### Test Integration
Tests import actual SafePrompt API code directly:
- `import { validatePrompt } from '/home/projects/safeprompt/api/lib/prompt-validator.js'`
- `import { validateWithAI } from '/home/projects/safeprompt/api/lib/ai-validator.js'`

This ensures tests run against the exact live code, not mocked versions.
- All 7 Cialdini persuasion principles with success rates
- Role-playing & persona attacks (DAN variants)
- Encoding & obfuscation methods (Unicode, Base64, etc.)
- Context manipulation (many-shot jailbreaking)
- Multimodal attacks (image/audio injection)
- 35+ documented jailbreak techniques from DEF CON and security research
- OWASP Top 10 for LLMs (2025)
- Detection strategies and mitigation effectiveness

**Purpose**: This represents the sum of human knowledge on AI manipulation techniques, compiled from academic papers, security research, red team competitions, and industry reports. Critical for keeping SafePrompt ahead of evolving threats.

## When Making Changes

### Pre-Flight Checklist (MANDATORY):
- [ ] Does the backend for this feature exist?
- [ ] Have I tested every link/button I'm adding?
- [ ] Are all database columns I'm using real?
- [ ] Is demo/beta status clearly marked?
- [ ] Am I showing real data, not fake numbers?
- [ ] Are emails going through contact form, not exposed?

### 🚨 ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID (Critical - Read This!)
**These patterns have caused major credibility issues:**

1. **NEVER create links to non-existent resources:**
   - ❌ GitHub repos that don't exist
   - ❌ Social media accounts not created
   - ❌ API endpoints not implemented
   - ❌ Pages not built (/blog, /docs, etc.)
   - ✅ Only link to things that actually exist

2. **NEVER show fake/hardcoded metrics:**
   - ❌ `useState(1247)` for user counts
   - ❌ "342 threats blocked" as static text
   - ❌ Random number animations
   - ✅ Query real data or show "---" if none

3. **NEVER reference non-existent packages:**
   - ❌ `npm install @safeprompt/js` when not published
   - ❌ Import statements for packages not in package.json
   - ✅ Use direct HTTP/API examples until packages exist

4. **NEVER use placeholder implementations:**
   - ❌ `onClick={() => alert('Coming soon')}`
   - ❌ `console.log('Would send email')`
   - ❌ `// TODO: Implement` in production
   - ✅ Either implement it or remove the UI element

5. **NEVER expose internal details:**
   - ❌ `mailto:support@safeprompt.dev`
   - ❌ Showing real API keys even partially
   - ✅ Always use contact forms, never direct emails

### Development Rules:
1. Keep it simple - no over-engineering
2. **Backend first, UI second** - Never reverse this
3. Optimize for developer experience
4. Maintain <200ms response time target (validated at P95=67ms)
5. Document API changes in docs/API.md
6. Update this file with major decisions
7. **NO TEMPORAL FILES** - Update existing docs to reflect current state only
8. Test files go in `/home/projects/user-input/claude-safeprompt/`
9. Never reference historical states - document as deprecated if needed
10. **If it doesn't work, mark it as "Coming Soon" or remove it**
11. **ALL customer contact through safeprompt.dev/contact form**

- `docs/BUSINESS.md` - Business strategy
- `docs/API.md` - API reference
- `docs/REALITY_CHECK.md` - Critical issues and validation requirements

## IMPORTANT: Documentation Reading Requirement
**ALL AI assistants working on this project MUST read ALL documents in the `/home/projects/safeprompt/docs/` folder before making any changes or recommendations.** These documents contain critical context about:
- Technical architecture and constraints
- Business model viability issues
- Performance reality checks
- Unit economics that need validation
- Go/no-go decision criteria

Failure to read these documents will result in repeating mistakes and building on false assumptions.

## 📚 Why AIs Miss Critical Knowledge (Lesson from 2025-09-25)
Even when deployment instructions exist in CLAUDE.md, they may be incomplete or lack critical details. Always:
1. **Test deployment commands fully** - Don't assume they work
2. **Check for multiple projects** - Vercel/Cloudflare can have duplicates
3. **Verify domain routing** - Deployment success ≠ accessible on custom domain
4. **Document pitfalls immediately** - Add to CLAUDE.md when discovered
5. **Use context7 for current docs** - Platform APIs change frequently

## 🎨 Website & Dashboard Design Philosophy (Added 2025-09-25)

### Website Design Principles
**Purpose**: Marketing site to convert visitors to trial users

1. **Timeless Over Trendy**
   - ❌ "New Features Just Launched!" sections (looks dated quickly)
   - ✅ "Enterprise-Ready Features" (evergreen positioning)
   - ❌ Mixing old and new features in separate sections (Frankenstein look)
   - ✅ One unified features grid showcasing all capabilities

2. **Clean Information Architecture**
   - Hero → Problem Education → Who Needs This → Core Features → Simple Integration → Pricing
   - Don't duplicate features across sections
   - Don't show complex code examples on marketing site
   - Point to dashboard for advanced features

3. **Integration Examples**
   - Website: ONE simple curl example showing basic usage
   - Dashboard: Full code examples in multiple languages + batch API
   - Reasoning: Developers already convinced by the time they're in dashboard

### Dashboard Design Principles
**Purpose**: Developer workspace for actual implementation

1. **Dashboard is the Developer Manual**
   - Full code examples in multiple languages
   - Advanced features documentation (batch API, caching)
   - Actual API key integration in examples when logged in
   - This is where complexity belongs, not marketing site

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Basic examples first (curl, JS, Python)
   - Advanced features section below (batch, caching)
   - Help links at bottom

### Critical Lesson: Feature Presentation
When adding new capabilities:
- ❌ DON'T bolt on "New Features" sections to existing pages
- ❌ DON'T duplicate similar features across multiple sections
- ❌ DON'T mix marketing (website) with implementation (dashboard)
- ✅ DO integrate features naturally into existing information flow
- ✅ DO keep marketing simple, implementation detailed
- ✅ DO maintain clear separation of concerns

### The Frankenstein Problem
**What happened**: Added new features section + kept old features section + added code examples = messy
**Solution**: Unified features grid, moved code to dashboard, kept website clean
**Rule**: When user says design looks "Frankenstein" or "cobbled together", they mean too many separate sections that should be unified

## 🎯 Target Audience Messaging (Critical Lesson 2025-09-25)

### The Enterprise Trap
**Problem**: Using "Enterprise-Ready Features" scared indie developers into thinking the product was complex
**Solution**: Changed to "Simple API, Powerful Features" with "Built for indie developers" messaging
**Key Insight**: Lead with simplicity, let enterprise features be a bonus, not a barrier

### Compliance Claims Caution
**Problem**: Claiming HIPAA/SOC2/GDPR compliance without certification is risky
**Solution**:
- Changed "Compliance Ready" to "Export Reports"
- Added "(coming soon)" or "(Beta)" labels
- CSV exports include disclaimer: "Working toward compliance certifications"
**Rule**: Never claim compliance without actual certification. Flag as "under development" to gather feedback

### Messaging Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Simple, one-line integration, no complexity
2. **Secondary**: Powerful features that scale with you
3. **Tertiary**: Enterprise capabilities (when you need them)
**Never lead with enterprise** - it scares away solo developers who think they need a team to use it

## 🔄 Feature Rollout Strategy (Learned 2025-09-25)

### When Adding New Features
1. **Research Phase**: Deep investigation without scope creep
2. **Prioritization**: Choose high-value, easy-to-implement features
3. **Implementation**: Backend first, then UI
4. **Integration**: Merge naturally into existing sections (avoid "New!" badges)
5. **Documentation**: Details in dashboard, simplicity on website

### Features Implemented in Phase 19
- ✅ Intelligent caching (30% cost reduction)
- ✅ Batch validation API (100 prompts/request)
- ✅ Usage reports (CSV export with metrics)
- ✅ Cache statistics tracking

### What NOT to Build (Scope Creep Examples)
- ❌ Webhook notifications (nice-to-have, not critical)
- ❌ Custom threat policies (complexity without clear value)
- ❌ Real-time threat feeds (operational overhead)
- ✅ Focus on: Speed, simplicity, cost savings
