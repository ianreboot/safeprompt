## Conclusion

The SafePrompt target audience (indie developers, vibe coders, small startups) is:

✅ **Highly aware** of prompt injection risks (OWASP, HackerNews coverage)
✅ **Motivated to protect** their AI applications (investor questions, reputation risk)
✅ **Price-sensitive** but willing to pay for value ($5-25/mo sweet spot)
✅ **Self-serve oriented** (hate sales calls, love free tiers)
✅ **Speed-focused** ("ship fast" culture, 60-second integration wins)
✅ **Trust through demonstration** (playground > testimonials)

**Critical Success Factor**: Match the audience's language, culture, and values. Don't try to be "enterprise". Be the indie-friendly, developer-first, transparent alternative to Lakera.

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement headline/content changes this week
2. Launch Product Hunt / HackerNews next week
3. Build GitHub presence and community in month 1
4. Scale based on feedback and traction
