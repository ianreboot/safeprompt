## üéØ MISSION OBJECTIVE (‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER EDIT THIS SECTION)

**THIS TASK EXISTS TO**: Deploy fixes for all 4 critical issues discovered in SafePrompt multi-environment audit to both DEV and PROD environments

**DELIVERABLE DEFINITION**:
- **Type**: Code fixes deployed to DEV and PROD environments
- **Location**: Multiple files across SafePrompt project + deployed to live URLs
- **Evidence**:
  - DEV dashboard connects to vkyggknknyfallmnrmfu (DEV database)
  - Both home pages claim "27 Attack Patterns" (not 15)
  - Test utility getTierLimits() returns correct values
  - Playground tier comments match actual counts
- **User Access**: Users see correct information on live websites, DEV ops use correct database

**SUCCESS CRITERIA** (All must be true):
- [x] DEV dashboard rebuilt with DEV database configuration (vkyggknknyfallmnrmfu)
- [x] Home page "15 Attack Patterns" changed to "27 Attack Patterns" in both DEV and PROD
- [x] Test utility early_bird limit: 5000‚Üí10000, business limit: 100000‚Üí250000
- [x] Playground tier comments: Tier 2 "(5)"‚Üí"(6)", Tier 4 "(7)"‚Üí"(6)"
- [x] All changes committed to git with descriptive messages (commits: 9a548d57, 70d98ac2, 16502bcf)
- [x] DEV environment redeployed and verified
- [x] PROD environment redeployed and verified

**NOT SUCCESS**:
- ‚ùå Only fixing DEV without verifying PROD consistency
- ‚ùå Fixing home page in source but not deploying
- ‚ùå Committing changes without verifying they work in deployed environments

**EXPECTED DURATION**: 2-4 hours
**DEPLOYMENT TARGET**: DEV (dev.safeprompt.dev, dev-dashboard.safeprompt.dev) and PROD (safeprompt.dev, dashboard.safeprompt.dev)

## üö® SYSTEM ACCESS PROTOCOL (‚ö†Ô∏è READ WHEN SYSTEMS FAIL)

**CRITICAL TRUTH**: All external systems work. Any assumption of failure (caching, timeouts, API limits) is a lack of knowledge, NOT a system problem.

### When You Encounter System Access Issues

**If Cloudflare Pages deployment fails:**
1. Read `/home/projects/docs/reference-cloudflare-access.md`
2. Common issue: Token not sourced correctly
3. All deployment patterns are documented
4. Use context7 for DNS issues

**If Supabase database operations fail:**
1. Read `/home/projects/docs/reference-supabase-access.md`
2. Common issue: Using wrong CLI method (use `supabase db push` not psql)
3. All authentication patterns are documented
4. Management API is available when CLI fails

**If Vercel Functions deployment fails:**
1. Read `/home/projects/docs/reference-vercel-access.md`
2. Common issue: Token quoting (must be unquoted: `--token $VERCEL_TOKEN`)
3. All deployment workflows are documented
4. Manual deployment required (no auto-deploy)

**If GitHub operations fail:**
1. Read `/home/projects/docs/reference-github-access.md`
2. Common issue: .env file special characters breaking source command
3. All authentication patterns are documented
4. Use embedded credentials for push

### Ground Truth

- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Pages works (100% uptime, instant deployment)
- ‚úÖ Supabase works (CLI + Management API both available)
- ‚úÖ Vercel works (manual deployment required, no auto-deploy)
- ‚úÖ GitHub works (PAT valid, all operations available)

**When something "doesn't work":**
1. It's a knowledge gap, not a system failure
2. Read the relevant reference doc
3. Follow the documented patterns exactly
4. The issue will resolve

## üîÑ CONTEXT REFRESH PROTOCOL (‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER EDIT THIS SECTION)

**When you see üß† CONTEXT REFRESH task in Detail doc, execute these steps:**

### STEP 1: Read Documents (In Order)
1. **Project CLAUDE.md**: `/home/projects/safeprompt/CLAUDE.md`
   - Deployment protocols specific to SafePrompt
   - Environment configuration requirements
   - Project-specific patterns and workflows
2. **This Master doc**: `/home/projects/safeprompt/docs/POST_AUDIT_REMEDIATION_MASTER.md`
   - Mission objective and success criteria
   - Current status and navigation
3. **Current Detail doc**: Listed in "Active Detail Doc" above
   - Task checklist and progress
   - Implementation details and commands

### STEP 2: Self-Awareness Check
‚ùì **Did I READ those docs or SEARCH them?**
   - If SEARCH: Execute rotation protocol
   - If READ: Proceed to Step 3

### STEP 3: Mission Alignment Check
‚ùì **Can I state the mission deliverable from memory?**
   - Fix 4 audit issues: DEV database, attack count, tier limits, comments
   - Deploy to both DEV and PROD environments

‚ùì **Do recent completed tasks move toward the deliverable?**
   - Review completed tasks in Detail doc
   - Verify they fix audit issues and deploy changes

‚ùì **What deliverable components exist RIGHT NOW?**
   - List fixed files
   - Verify deployments with curl/browser checks

### STEP 4: Update Current Detail Doc
1. Mark completed tasks
2. Add entry to Progress Log with evidence
3. Document discoveries
4. Update state variables

### STEP 5: Update Master Status (This Doc)
Update "Current Status" section above

## üîÑ ROTATION PROTOCOL (‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER EDIT THIS SECTION)

**Execute when**: You find yourself SEARCHING Detail doc instead of READING it

**Steps**:
1. Create new Detail doc: `POST_AUDIT_REMEDIATION_DETAILS_02.md`
2. Move current: `mv DETAILS_01.md DETAILS_01.old.md`
3. Update Master Navigation Map (add row, mark as ROTATED)
4. Update Master Current Status (point to new doc)
5. Continue work in new Detail doc

## üÜò RECOVERY FOR FRESH AI (‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER EDIT THIS SECTION)

**If you're joining after auto-compaction with zero memory:**

1. **You are here**: Master control doc
2. **Read Mission**: "Mission Objective" section above
3. **Find current work**: Open `POST_AUDIT_REMEDIATION_DETAILS_01.md`
4. **Locate your task**: Find first uncompleted `[ ]` task
5. **Execute task**: Do the work, update docs
6. **Repeat**: Until you hit üß† CONTEXT REFRESH task
