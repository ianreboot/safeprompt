└── CONTRIBUTING.md
```

**README.md Content Priorities**:
1. Problem statement (what is prompt injection?)
2. Quick start (5-minute integration)
3. Live demo link (safeprompt.dev/playground)
4. Pricing transparency ($0-$5/mo)
5. Performance metrics (98% accuracy, ~350ms)
6. Examples folder link
7. Contributing guidelines

**GitHub Badges to Add**:

- ![Free Tier](https://img.shields.io/badge/free_tier-10K_requests%2Fmonth-blue)

### 1.2 Open Source Examples

**Create Public Repos** (linked from main repo):
1. `safeprompt-nextjs-example` - Full Next.js app with SafePrompt
2. `safeprompt-express-example` - Express API integration
3. `safeprompt-python-example` - FastAPI/Flask integration

**Each example includes**:
- Working code (can clone and run immediately)
- Environment variable setup instructions
- Attack test cases
- Performance benchmarking script

### 1.3 Community Engagement

**Active Presence**:
- Watch related repos (prompt-injection, llm-guard, etc.)
- Comment helpfully on relevant issues
- Submit PRs to ecosystem projects (good for visibility)
- Respond to GitHub issues within 24 hours

**Contribution Opportunities**:
- Accept PRs for new framework examples
- Community-contributed attack patterns
- Documentation improvements
- Language translations

---

## 2. HackerNews Strategy (Critical for Credibility)

### 2.1 "Show HN" Post

**Timing**: Week 2 (after GitHub repo is polished)

**Title Options** (test in order):
1. "Show HN: SafePrompt - $5/mo Prompt Injection Protection API"
2. "Show HN: Protect AI Apps from Prompt Injection (98% accuracy, API-first)"
3. "Show HN: I Built a Prompt Security API for Indie Devs"

**Post Structure**:
```
Show HN: SafePrompt - Prompt injection protection for $5/mo

I'm an indie dev who built SafePrompt after getting burned by prompt injection
in my own AI app. It's an API-first security layer that blocks manipulation
attempts before they reach your LLM.

Key details:
- 98% accuracy on professional test suite (94 attacks tested)
- ~350ms added latency (3-layer validation: regex + AI)
- Free tier: 10,000 requests/month
- Paid: $5/mo for 100,000 requests (beta pricing)

Built for developers who ship fast and can't afford enterprise solutions like
Lakera Guard. No sales calls, instant API key, transparent pricing.

Live playground: https://safeprompt.dev/playground
GitHub: https://github.com/ianreboot/safeprompt
Docs: https://safeprompt.dev/docs

Would love feedback from the community, especially on:
1. Attack patterns I'm missing
2. Integration friction points
3. Pricing structure (too high/low?)

Happy to answer questions!
```

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Monitor post for first 4 hours
- Respond to ALL comments within 1 hour
- Be humble and receptive to criticism
- Acknowledge valid concerns honestly
- Provide technical details when asked
- Thank people for trying it

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- Overly promotional tone
- Dismissing criticism
- Comparison attacks on competitors
- Vague technical claims
- "Revolutionary" or other buzzwords

### 2.2 Technical Blog Posts (HN Submission)

**Post 1**: "How I Reduced Prompt Injection False Positives by 50%"

- Real code examples
- Performance benchmarks
- Lessons learned

**Post 2**: "Testing 94 Real Prompt Injection Attacks: What Worked, What Didn't"

- Where AI models struggle
- Link to GitHub test suite

**Post 3**: "The Economics of Prompt Injection Protection"
- Cost analysis: DIY vs API vs Enterprise
- Engineering time calculations
- When each approach makes sense
- Transparent business model explanation

**Submission Timing**:
- Post 1: Week 3
- Post 2: Week 5
- Post 3: Week 8

**Success Criteria**:
- 20+ upvotes = good traction
- 50+ upvotes = viral potential
- Comments from known security researchers = credibility boost

**Maker Comment** (post immediately):
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Ian, indie dev behind SafePrompt. I built this after getting burned by
prompt injection in my own AI app last year.

The problem: Attackers can manipulate AI apps to leak data, bypass restrictions,
or execute harmful commands. Existing solutions (Lakera Guard) require sales
calls and enterprise budgets.

SafePrompt is API-first protection built for developers who:
- Ship fast and can't waste time on complex integration
- Can't afford $X,000/mo enterprise contracts
- Want transparent pricing and instant access

**What makes it different:**
✅ Free tier (10K requests/month, no credit card)
✅ One API call integration
✅ $5/mo for 100K requests (vs thousands for alternatives)
✅ Open-source attack test suite
✅ Live playground to try attacks

**I'd love your feedback on:**
1. Integration experience (is 60 seconds realistic?)
2. Pricing ($5/mo too high/low for value?)
3. Attack patterns I should add
4. Feature requests

Thanks for checking it out! I'll be here all day answering questions. 🙌
```
