# API Documentation Sanitization Report

Generated: 2025-10-21

## Summary

Created `PUBLIC_API.md` as a sanitized version of `API.md` for public documentation at docs.safeprompt.dev.

## üö® REMOVED (Security-Sensitive)

### 1. Admin Endpoints Section (ENTIRE SECTION)
**Original Location**: Lines 488-540
**Reason**: Exposes internal admin API structure and bypass mechanisms

**Removed Content**:
- POST `/v1/admin/ip-allowlist` - IP allowlist management endpoint
- DELETE `/v1/admin/ip-allowlist/:id` - IP allowlist removal endpoint
- `sp_internal_ADMIN_KEY` format revelation
- IP allowlist bypass mechanism details

**Risk Prevented**: Attackers knowing admin endpoints exist and their structure

---

### 2. Test Suite Bypass Header
**Original Location**: Line 412
**Content Removed**: `X-SafePrompt-Test-Suite: <token>` bypass mechanism

**Original Text**:
```
**Bypass mechanisms:**
1. Test suite header: `X-SafePrompt-Test-Suite: <token>`
2. IP allowlist: Add IP to `ip_allowlist` table (for CI/CD)
3. Internal tier: Always bypasses reputation checks
```

**Public Version**:
```
**Note**: Allowlisted IPs and test infrastructure bypass reputation checks for operational purposes.
```

**Risk Prevented**: Attackers attempting to use test suite bypass header

---

### 3. Internal Tier References
**Original Locations**: Lines 377, 414, and throughout
**Content Removed**: All mentions of "internal tier" privilege level

**Examples Removed**:
- "**Internal tier**: Never collects"
- "Internal tier: Always bypasses reputation checks"

**Risk Prevented**: Revealing existence of privileged access tier

---

### 4. Exact Auto-Block Thresholds
**Original Location**: Line 395
**Original Text**: "Block rate > 80% AND sample count ‚â• 5"

**Public Version**: "IP addresses with consistent attack patterns may be automatically blocked"

**Risk Prevented**: Attackers gaming the system by staying under precise thresholds

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SANITIZED (Business-Sensitive)

### 5. Intelligence Collection Logic
**Original Location**: Lines 369-383

**Original (Detailed)**:
```
- Tier-based collection rules:
  - **Free tier**: Blocked requests only (`safe: false`)
  - **Pro tier**: All requests if `intelligence_sharing: true` (default ON)
  - **Internal tier**: Never collects
```

**Public (Sanitized)**:
```
- Tier-based collection:
  - **Free tier**: Blocked requests only (`safe: false`)
  - **Pro tier**: All requests if `intelligence_sharing: true` (default ON, can opt-out)
```

**Change**: Removed internal tier mention, kept core functionality documented

---

### 6. Deprecated Endpoints
**Original Location**: Lines 417-486
**Action**: Removed entirely from public docs

**Removed Endpoints**:
- DELETE `/v1/privacy/delete` (deprecated)
- GET `/v1/privacy/export` (deprecated)

**Reason**: These are fully replaced by GDPR endpoints. Including them causes developer confusion.

---

### 7. IP Reputation Response Details
**Original Location**: Lines 622-647

**Sanitized**:
- Removed specific error response for "reputation_check_failed"
- Simplified IP blocking error response
- Kept core functionality documented but removed internal error handling details

---

## ‚úÖ ENHANCED (Improvements)

### 8. Additional Code Examples
**Added**:
- Go example (complete implementation)
- Ruby example (complete implementation)
- Multi-turn protection example in Best Practices

**Reason**: Better serve developer audience with more language coverage

---

### 9. Best Practices Section
**Enhanced**:
- Added "Multi-Turn Protection" example with session token usage
- Expanded fail-open strategy explanation
- Added caching example with TTL

---

- ‚úÖ Threat types list matches production code
- ‚úÖ Processing time ranges match performance metrics

### Endpoints - VERIFIED ACCURATE
- ‚úÖ POST /v1/validate - Correct request/response format
- ‚úÖ GET /v1/account/preferences - Correct response structure
- ‚úÖ PATCH /v1/account/preferences - Correct request format
- ‚úÖ POST /api/gdpr/delete-user-data - Correct endpoint path
- ‚úÖ GET /api/gdpr/export-user-data - Correct response format
- ‚úÖ GET /status - Correct system status response

### Rate Limits - VERIFIED ACCURATE
- ‚úÖ Free: 10 req/s, 10K monthly
- ‚úÖ Early Bird: 50 req/s, 100K monthly
- ‚úÖ Pro: 100 req/s, 1M monthly

### Error Codes - VERIFIED ACCURATE
- ‚úÖ 200, 400, 401, 403, 429, 500 all documented
- ‚úÖ Error response formats match API implementation

## üîí Security Review Result

**APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE** with the following safeguards:

‚úÖ No admin endpoints exposed
‚úÖ No bypass mechanisms revealed
‚úÖ No internal tier references
‚úÖ No precise attack thresholds
‚úÖ No business secrets leaked
‚úÖ GDPR compliance maintained
‚úÖ Developer experience preserved

## üìù Recommendations for docs.safeprompt.dev

1. **Use PUBLIC_API.md** as the source for API reference documentation
2. **Keep API.md internal** for team reference only
3. **Add to .gitignore**: Ensure API.md never gets committed to public repos
4. **Regular audits**: Review API.md quarterly for new sensitive content before public updates

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create PUBLIC_API.md (COMPLETE)
2. ‚è≥ Set up docs.safeprompt.dev subdomain
3. ‚è≥ Build docs site structure
4. ‚è≥ Deploy PUBLIC_API.md to docs site
5. ‚è≥ Verify docs are accessible and accurate
