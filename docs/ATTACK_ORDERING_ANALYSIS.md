# Attack Vector Ordering & Naming Analysis

## Current Issues

### Naming Problems:
1. **Inconsistent prefixes** - Some have category (XSS, SQL), some don't
2. **Unclear attack type** - "Event Handler Injection" doesn't say it's XSS
3. **Missing context** - "Polyglot" appears twice with different meanings
4. **Vague names** - "System Override" vs "Instruction Override" vs "Management Override"
5. **Year tags** - "DevMode Jailbreak (2025)" - year is unnecessary
6. **Category confusion** - Mixed XSS, SQL, prompt injection without clear grouping

### Ordering Problems:
1. **Random complexity** - Simple and complex attacks mixed together
2. **No progression** - Doesn't teach from basic → advanced
3. **Multi-turn placement** - Complex multi-turn attacks scattered in middle
4. **No logical flow** - Jump between attack types without pattern

## Proposed Reorganization

### Complexity Tiers (by Attacker Effort):

**TIER 1: Copy-Paste Attacks** (Beginner - No special knowledge)
- Attacker effort: Copy from tutorial
- Skill required: None
- Examples: Classic SQL injection, basic script tags

**TIER 2: Technique-Based Attacks** (Intermediate - Requires some knowledge)
- Attacker effort: Understand encoding, contexts, or protocols
- Skill required: Basic security knowledge
- Examples: Entity encoding, attribute breaks, language switching

**TIER 3: Creative/Strategic Attacks** (Advanced - Requires planning)
- Attacker effort: Multi-step, social engineering, or creative thinking
- Skill required: Advanced tactics
- Examples: Semantic extraction, business context, jailbreaks

**TIER 4: Sophisticated Attacks** (Expert - Requires patience/expertise)
- Attacker effort: Multi-turn sequences, universal payloads
- Skill required: Expert planning and execution
- Examples: Multi-turn attacks, universal polyglots

## Pedagogical Benefits of New Order

### Progressive Learning:
1. **Start simple** - Build confidence with copy-paste attacks
2. **Add technique** - Introduce encoding, contexts, languages
3. **Strategic thinking** - Move to semantic/social engineering
4. **Advanced tactics** - End with multi-step and polyglots

### Clear Tiers:
- Users can see progression from beginner → expert
- Each tier introduces new concept/skill
- Natural difficulty curve

### Better UX:
- Beginners start at top (easy wins)
- Advanced users scroll to bottom (challenges)
- Tier separation makes it easy to find appropriate level

## Recommendation

**Primary recommendation: Order by COMPLEXITY (Tier 1-4)**

Why:
- Better learning progression
- Users naturally progress from simple → advanced
- Makes playground feel like a tutorial
- Each tier teaches new concept
- Clear difficulty curve

**Secondary option: Order by TYPE**

Why:
- Groups related attacks together
- Easier to compare similar techniques
- Better for developers learning specific attack categories
- More like a reference guide

---

## Questions for Decision

1. **Complexity vs Type ordering?**
   - Complexity = better for beginners, tutorial-like
   - Type = better for experts, reference-like

2. **Keep "Basic" prefix?**
   - Pro: Shows difficulty clearly
   - Con: Might seem redundant if ordered by complexity

3. **Multi-turn placement?**
   - Should complex multi-turn be at end?
   - Or group with other prompt injection?

4. **Category names?**
   - "Basic XSS" vs just "XSS"?
   - "Prompt Injection" vs "System Manipulation"?
   - "Social Engineering" vs "Business Context"?

5. **Turn count in name?**
   - "Multi-Turn: Reconnaissance (2 turns)" - clear but verbose
   - "Multi-Turn: Reconnaissance" - cleaner but less info
