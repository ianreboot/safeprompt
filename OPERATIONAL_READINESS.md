# SafePrompt Operational Readiness Checklist

## Current Status: MVP DEPLOYED, NOT OPERATIONALLY READY
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-24

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Cannot accept real customers)

### 1. Waitlist Form - Database Table Missing
- **Status**: ⚠️ CODE READY, TABLE MISSING
- **Issue**: Waitlist table not created in Supabase database
- **Impact**: Cannot capture interested users
- **Fix Required**: Run SQL in Supabase dashboard (see SUPABASE_SETUP.md)
- **Time to Fix**: 5 minutes

### 2. Payment → Account Creation
- **Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: Stripe webhook exists but doesn't create accounts
- **Impact**: Customers can pay but get nothing
- **Fix Required**: Process webhook events, generate API keys

### 3. No Legal Pages
- **Status**: ❌ MISSING
- **Issue**: No Terms of Service or Privacy Policy
- **Impact**: Legal liability, trust issues
- **Fix Required**: Adapt from reboot project templates

### 4. No Email System
- **Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: Cannot send API keys or notifications
- **Impact**: No way to deliver service after payment
- **Fix Required**: Implement Resend integration

## ⚠️ OPERATIONAL GAPS (Can launch but painful)

### 5. No Admin Visibility
- **Status**: ⚠️ MANUAL ONLY
- **Current**: Must query Supabase directly
- **Impact**: Cannot manage users efficiently
- **Workaround**: Use Supabase dashboard

### 6. No Usage Tracking
- **Status**: ⚠️ NOT ENFORCED
- **Current**: Code exists but not connected
- **Impact**: Users could exceed limits
- **Workaround**: Monitor manually

### 7. No Error Monitoring
- **Status**: ⚠️ BLIND
- **Current**: No visibility into failures
- **Impact**: Won't know about problems
- **Workaround**: Check logs manually
