# SafePrompt Operational Readiness Checklist

## Current Status: MVP DEPLOYED, NOT OPERATIONALLY READY
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-24

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Cannot accept real customers)

### 1. No User Dashboard
- **Status**: ❌ NOT BUILT
- **Issue**: No way for users to view/manage API keys
- **Impact**: Cannot deliver service professionally
- **Fix Required**: Build dashboard.safeprompt.dev with Supabase Auth
- **Time to Fix**: 2-3 days

### 2. No Admin Dashboard
- **Status**: ❌ NOT BUILT
- **Issue**: Cannot manage users or waitlist
- **Impact**: Cannot onboard beta users
- **Fix Required**: Build admin panel at /admin
- **Time to Fix**: 1 day

### 3. Email System (Notifications Only)
- **Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: Cannot send welcome emails or notifications
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, no confirmations
- **Fix Required**: Implement Resend for notifications (NOT for API keys)
- **Time to Fix**: 4 hours

### 4. Payment → Account Creation
- **Status**: ❌ INCOMPLETE
- **Issue**: Stripe webhook doesn't create accounts or generate keys
- **Impact**: Customers pay but cannot access service
- **Fix Required**: Complete webhook to create accounts and store API keys
- **Time to Fix**: 2 hours

## ⚠️ OPERATIONAL GAPS (Can launch but painful)

### 5. No Admin Visibility
- **Status**: ⚠️ MANUAL ONLY
- **Current**: Must query Supabase directly
- **Impact**: Cannot manage users efficiently
- **Workaround**: Use Supabase dashboard

### 6. No Usage Tracking
- **Status**: ⚠️ NOT ENFORCED
- **Current**: Code exists but not connected
- **Impact**: Users could exceed limits
- **Workaround**: Monitor manually

### 7. No Error Monitoring
- **Status**: ⚠️ BLIND
- **Current**: No visibility into failures
- **Impact**: Won't know about problems
- **Workaround**: Check logs manually
