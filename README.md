## What is SafePrompt?

SafePrompt protects your AI applications from prompt injection attacks. One API call. No SDKs required (but available). No complex rules to write. Just instant protection.

```javascript
// Option 1: NPM Package (recommended)

import { SafePrompt } from '@safeprompt/client';
const safeprompt = new SafePrompt('sp_live_YOUR_KEY');

const result = await safeprompt.validate(userInput);
if (!result.safe) {
  throw new Error('Prompt blocked: potential injection detected');
}

// Option 2: Direct HTTP API (any language)
const response = await fetch('https://api.safeprompt.dev/api/v1/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'sp_live_YOUR_KEY',
    'X-User-IP': req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.connection.remoteAddress,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: userInput,
    mode: 'optimized',
    sessionToken: sessionId  // Optional: for multi-turn attack detection
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
if (!result.safe) {
  throw new Error('Prompt blocked: potential injection detected');
}
```

## What's New (October 2025)

## Why SafePrompt?

### The Problem
Every AI application is vulnerable to prompt injection. Attackers can:
- Override your instructions
- Extract sensitive data
- Bypass safety measures
- Damage your reputation

**Real example**: Chevrolet sold a $60,000 car for $1 because of prompt injection.

### Why Not Just... ?

**"I'll build my own regex"**
- Takes 20+ hours. 43% accuracy. Constant updates.
- SafePrompt: $0.50 per 100K. 98% accuracy. Zero maintenance.

**"I'll use Claude's built-in filter"**
- 88% block rate = 12% slip through.
- SafePrompt: 98% accuracy. Catches multi-turn attacks.

**"I'll use an enterprise tool"**
- $X,XXX/month. Sales calls. Complex integration.
- SafePrompt: $5-$99/mo. Self-serve. One API call.

**"I'll just hope nobody attacks me"**
- Chevrolet sold a $60K car for $1.
- SafePrompt: Sleep better.

### Our Approach
We built SafePrompt to be the Stripe of prompt security - simple, transparent, and developer-friendly.

## How It Works

### Core Validation Pipeline
1. **XSS Pattern Detection** (0ms): Catches script injection and obfuscation techniques
2. **Template Injection Detection** (0ms): Detects server-side template exploitation
3. **External Reference Detection** (5ms): Blocks URLs, IPs, file paths (including encoded/obfuscated)
4. **Pattern Matching** (0ms): Fast detection of known attack patterns
5. **AI Orchestrator** (~100ms): Intelligent routing determines which validators to invoke
6. **Specialized Validators** (parallel): Business context, attack detection, semantic analysis
7. **Consensus Engine**: Multi-validator voting with smart escalation
8. **Pass 2 Deep Analysis** (~2s): Triggered for ambiguous cases only (~5% of requests)
9. **Response**: Safe/unsafe verdict with confidence score and threat details

### Advanced Protection (Phase 1A - October 2025)

**Threat Intelligence Collection:**
- **Free tier**: Contributes blocked attacks, benefits from network-wide pattern discovery (cannot opt-out)
- **Paid tiers**: Contributes all requests (if opted-in, default: true), can opt-out BUT loses network benefits if opted-out
- **Key principle**: Only contributors benefit from collective intelligence
- 24-hour PII retention: Prompt text + IP addresses deleted after 24 hours (GDPR/CCPA compliant)
- Permanent attack pattern storage: Cryptographic hashes persist for network defense

**IP Logging for Threat Intelligence (paid tiers: Early Bird/Starter/Business):**
- Hash-based tracking: Correlates attack patterns by IP address for threat intelligence
- Real-time pattern analysis: Every validation contributes to IP-based threat correlation
- Helps identify: Coordinated attacks, distributed attack patterns, persistent threat actors

**Multi-Turn Attack Detection (95% accuracy):**
- Session-based validation tracks conversation history across multiple requests
- Reconnaissance attack detection: Catches safe information gathering followed by exploitation (100% detection rate)
- Context priming detection: Blocks fake ticket references, false authorization claims, temporal proof building
- Gradual escalation protection: Detects progressive privilege requests (100% detection rate)
- Social engineering chains: Identifies urgency claims leading to security bypass (100% detection rate)
- RAG poisoning protection: Detects malicious document injection attempts (100% detection rate)
- Additional patterns: Encoding chains, role confusion, sudden escalation
- 2-hour session TTL with automatic cleanup

**Privacy & Compliance:**
- **Free tier**: Contributes blocked attacks ‚Üí Benefits from network intelligence (required)
- **Paid tiers**: Default opted-in (contributes all requests ‚Üí gets network intelligence + IP-based threat correlation), can opt-out via Settings ‚Üí Privacy (loses network benefits, keeps own data only)
- **Key principle**: Only contributors benefit from collective intelligence
- GDPR right to deletion: Delete all identifiable data via API
- GDPR right to access: Export all data associated with your account

## API Documentation

See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for complete API reference.

### Custom Lists

**NEW (October 2025)**: Define business-specific phrases to guide AI validation decisions.

#### How It Works
Custom lists provide **confidence signals** to the AI validator, not instant block/allow decisions:
- **Blacklist match** (0.9 confidence) ‚Üí Routes to AI with high attack signal
- **Whitelist match** (0.8 confidence) ‚Üí Routes to AI with high business signal
- **Pattern detection always runs** (XSS, SQL injection cannot be overridden)

#### API Usage

```javascript
// Option 1: Per-request custom rules
const response = await fetch('https://api.safeprompt.dev/api/v1/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'sp_live_YOUR_KEY',
    'X-User-IP': userIP,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: userInput,
    customRules: {
      whitelist: ['shipping address', 'customer service', 'order tracking'],
      blacklist: ['admin override', 'system prompt']
    }
  })
});

// Option 2: Use profile-level lists (managed in dashboard)
// No need to pass customRules - uses your saved lists
const response = await fetch('https://api.safeprompt.dev/api/v1/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'sp_live_YOUR_KEY',
    'X-User-IP': userIP,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: userInput })
});

// Check if custom rule matched
if (result.customRuleMatched) {
  console.log(`Matched ${result.customRuleMatched.type}: "${result.customRuleMatched.phrase}"`);
}
```

#### Dashboard Management
Manage your custom lists at `https://dashboard.safeprompt.dev/custom-lists`:
- Add/edit/delete custom phrases
- View tier limits (X/Y phrases used)
- Toggle default lists on/off
- Remove specific default phrases (paid tiers)

#### Tier Limits
- **Free**: Default lists only (read-only)
- **Starter**: 25 whitelist + 25 blacklist phrases
- **Business**: 100 whitelist + 100 blacklist phrases
- **Internal**: 200 whitelist + 200 blacklist phrases

#### Important Notes
- **Blacklist priority**: Blacklist always wins over whitelist
- **Security first**: XSS/SQL patterns cannot be overridden by whitelist
- **Three-layer merging**: Request custom rules > Profile custom rules > Default lists
- **Case insensitive**: Matching is case-insensitive ("Admin" matches "admin")
