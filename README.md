## What is SafePrompt?

SafePrompt protects your AI applications from prompt injection attacks. Built for developers who need security without complexity - whether you're working on a side project, building for a client, or scaling a business. No SDKs to install, no complex rules to write - just POST to our API and you're protected.

```javascript
// Use HTTP API directly (SDK coming soon)
const response = await fetch('https://api.safeprompt.dev/api/v1/validate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sp_live_YOUR_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: userInput })
});

const result = await response.json();
if (!result.safe) {
  throw new Error('Prompt blocked: potential injection detected');
}
```

## Features

- **üöÄ One-Line Integration**: Literally just POST to /check
- **‚ö° 5ms Response**: Your users won't even notice
- **üí∞ 30% Cost Savings**: Smart caching reduces your bill automatically
- **üìä Batch Processing**: Validate 100 prompts in one call
- **üõ°Ô∏è Real Protection**: Not just regex - multi-layer AI validation
- **üìà Usage Dashboard**: See threats blocked, track usage, export reports

## Quick Start

**Note**: NPM package coming soon. For now, use the HTTP API directly.

1. **Sign up** at [safeprompt.dev](https://safeprompt.dev)
2. **Access your dashboard** at [dashboard.safeprompt.dev](https://dashboard.safeprompt.dev) to get your API key
3. **Add validation** to your AI calls using the HTTP API:

```javascript
// Before (vulnerable)
const response = await openai.complete(userInput);

// After (protected)
const validation = await safeprompt.check(userInput);
if (validation.safe) {
  const response = await openai.complete(userInput);
}
```


## Pricing

- **Free**: 10,000 validations/month - Full AI protection, community support
- **Early Bird**: $5/month - 100,000 validations/month, priority support, 99.9% uptime SLA (beta pricing)

Both tiers include the SAME technology - full regex + AI validation with 99.9% accuracy.

## Why SafePrompt?

### The Problem
Every AI application is vulnerable to prompt injection. Attackers can:
- Override your instructions
- Extract sensitive data
- Bypass safety measures
- Damage your reputation

### Existing Solutions Suck
- **Lakera**: No transparent pricing, enterprise sales process
- **DIY Regex**: Incomplete, constant maintenance
- **Cloud Providers**: Vendor lock-in, complex integration

### Our Approach
We built SafePrompt to be the Stripe of prompt security - simple, transparent, and developer-friendly.

## How It Works

1. **External Reference Detection** (5ms): Blocks URLs, IPs, file paths (including encoded/obfuscated)
2. **Pattern Matching** (0ms): Fast detection of known attack patterns
3. **Pass 1 AI Validation** (~200ms): Llama 8B for quick risk assessment
4. **Pass 2 AI Validation** (~400ms): Llama 70B for uncertain cases only
5. **Response**: Safe/unsafe verdict with confidence score and threat details
