## üéØ MISSION OBJECTIVE (‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER EDIT THIS SECTION)

**THIS TASK EXISTS TO**: Deploy custom whitelist/blacklist feature to production that allows paid users to define business-specific phrases that guide AI validation decisions while maintaining core security.

**DELIVERABLE DEFINITION**:
- **Type**: Working production feature with database schema, API integration, dashboard UI, and documentation
- **Location**:
  - Code: `/home/projects/safeprompt/api/lib/custom-lists-*.js`
  - Database: Supabase PROD + DEV with migrations
  - UI: `https://dashboard.safeprompt.dev/custom-lists`
  - Docs: `/home/projects/safeprompt/docs/API.md` + website
- **Evidence**:
  - API accepts `customRules` parameter and returns attribution
  - Dashboard shows custom lists management UI
  - Tests pass (unit + realistic suite updated)
  - curl test succeeds with whitelist override
- **User Access**:
  - Free tier: Read-only default lists at dashboard
  - Starter+ tier: Edit lists, add custom phrases at `/custom-lists`
  - API: Send `customRules` in request body

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- [x] API endpoint accepts customRules parameter and processes correctly
- [x] Default lists replace current business/educational keyword system
- [x] Free tier gets default lists (read-only), paid tiers can edit
- [x] Dashboard UI allows adding/editing/removing custom phrases
- [x] Blacklist always wins over whitelist (clear priority)
- [x] Custom lists work as routing/override signals (not instant decisions)
- [x] Pattern detection (XSS/SQL) CANNOT be overridden by whitelist
- [x] External references CANNOT be overridden by whitelist
- [x] Test #29 ("Override shipping address") passes with default whitelist
- [x] All unit tests pass (852 tests total, 132 custom lists tests)
- [x] Realistic test suite updated with custom lists scenarios
- [x] Documentation complete (API, dashboard, website, public repo)
- [x] Deployed to DEV, tested, then deployed to PROD

**NOT SUCCESS**:
- ‚ùå Custom lists as instant block/allow (they're routing signals, not decisions)
- ‚ùå Whitelist overriding pattern detection (XSS, SQL, etc.)
- ‚ùå Blacklist acting as instant block (should route to AI with context)
- ‚ùå Breaking existing tests without understanding why
- ‚ùå Deploying without testing in DEV first

**EXPECTED DURATION**: 3-4 days
**DEPLOYMENT TARGET**: SafePrompt Production (api.safeprompt.dev + dashboard.safeprompt.dev)

## üîÑ CONTEXT REFRESH PROTOCOL (‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER EDIT THIS SECTION)

**When you see üß† CONTEXT REFRESH task in Detail doc, execute these steps:**

### STEP 1: Read Documents (In Order) - MANDATORY EVERY REFRESH

**1.1 Project CLAUDE.md** (ALWAYS READ FIRST):
- Path: `/home/projects/safeprompt/CLAUDE.md`
- Why: Contains deployment protocols, critical patterns, project-specific requirements
- Common failure point: Processes beyond AI training data stored here

**1.2 Platform-Specific Reference Doc** (READ IF WORKING WITH THAT SYSTEM):
Identify which system your next task involves, then read the appropriate reference:
- **Supabase** (database operations)? ‚Üí `/home/projects/docs/reference-supabase-access.md`
- **Vercel** (API deployment)? ‚Üí `/home/projects/docs/reference-vercel-access.md`
- **Cloudflare** (frontend deployment)? ‚Üí `/home/projects/docs/reference-cloudflare-access.md`

Why: These contain proven patterns, correct authentication, and solutions to common issues

**1.3 This Master Doc**:
- Mission objective + current status

**1.4 Current Detail Doc**:
- Listed in "Active Detail Doc" above

### STEP 2: Self-Awareness Check
‚ùì **Did I READ those docs or SEARCH them?**
   - Search signs: Used grep/keywords, scanned for task numbers, skimmed
   - Read signs: Comprehended mission, recall phase goals, understood context

‚ùì **Can I state the mission objective from memory?**
   - If NO: You searched, didn't read ‚Üí EXECUTE ROTATION PROTOCOL
   - If YES: Proceed to Step 3

### STEP 3: Mission Alignment Check
‚ùì **Can I state the mission deliverable from memory?**
   - Type? Location? Evidence? User access?

‚ùì **Do recent completed tasks move toward the deliverable?**
   - Are they creating components of the working feature?

‚ùì **What deliverable components exist RIGHT NOW?**
   - List actual files/systems created
   - Verify they exist (ls, grep)

### STEP 4: Troubleshooting Protocol (If Stuck)

**üö® CRITICAL REMINDER: ALL SYSTEMS WORK**

If something isn't working (API errors, deployment fails, authentication issues):
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: "The system is down" / "Waiting for propagation" / "Token expired" / "Can't be done programmatically"
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: "My knowledge is outdated or incomplete - checking reference docs and context7"

**Troubleshooting Sequence**:
1. **First**: Re-read the platform reference doc for that system (Supabase/Vercel/Cloudflare)
2. **Second**: Use context7 to get current API documentation
   - Example: "use context7 to show Supabase migration syntax for 2025"
   - Example: "use context7 for Vercel deployment authentication"
3. **Third**: Check `/home/projects/safeprompt/docs/PATTERNS.md` for known error patterns

**Why**: These systems are in production and working for thousands of users. If you hit an error, it's a knowledge gap (training data outdated, missing pattern), not a system failure. Reference docs and context7 bridge that gap.

### STEP 5: Update Current Detail Doc
1. Mark completed tasks in checklist
2. Add entry to Progress Log with evidence
3. Document discoveries/findings
4. Update state variables

### STEP 6: Update Master Status (This Doc)
Update "Current Status" section above:
- Current task number and phase
- Tasks completed count and percentage
- Last update timestamp
- Mission alignment check result
